            <br>
            <p> Medusa is one of the offspring of the ancient marine deities Phorcys and Ceto, chthonic monsters from an archaic world, the others being Stheno, and Euryale. 
                Her lineage is connected with the Graeae sisters, mentioned in Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound, situating both sets of sisters on Kisthene's dreadful plain.
                <br>
                <br>
                In ancient Greek art, Medusa and her sisters were initially depicted as monstrous beings. However, during the fifth century BC, sculptors and vase-painters 
                started envisioning Medusa not only as fearsome but also as beautiful. Pindar referred to "fair-cheeked Medusa" in an ode written in 490 BC.
                <br>
                <br>
                Classical Greek art showcased Medusa's portrayal transitioning from a hideous creature to an attractive young woman, portrayed as both aggressor and victim, 
                embodying a tragic figure in her death. Polygnotus depicted Medusa as a peaceful and comely woman, asleep as Perseus beheaded her. However, the act of killing 
                a beautiful maiden in her sleep poses ambiguityâ€”whether these depictions were intended to evoke sympathy for Medusa's fate or to satirize the traditional hero.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the prevalent version of the myth, Perseus, the hero, was tasked by King Polydectes of Seriphus to obtain Medusa's head. Polydectes desired to marry Perseus's 
                mother, and Perseus sought help from the gods. Athena provided him with a mirrored shield, Hermes granted him sandals with wings, Hephaestus gave him a sword, and 
                Hades offered his helm of invisibility. As Medusa was the only mortal Gorgon, Perseus was able to slay her by using the mirrored shield to look at her reflection. 
                At the time, Medusa was pregnant by Poseidon. When she was beheaded by Perseus, her body gave birth to Pegasus, a winged horse, and Chrysaor, a giant wielding a 
                golden sword.
