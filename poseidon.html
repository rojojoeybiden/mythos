            <br>
            <p> In ancient Greek religion, Poseidon was revered as the god of the sea and all water-related elements, earthquakes, and horses. He held a distinct role separate from Pontus, 
                who personified the sea and was the most ancient Greek water deity. The name "Poseidon" signified either "spouse of the earth" or "ruler of the earth." Traditionally, he was 
                the offspring of Cronus, the youngest of the 12 Titans, and Cronus's sister Rhea, who was also his consort and a fertility goddess. Poseidon counted among his siblings Zeus, 
                the chief deity of ancient Greece and god of the sky, and Hades, the ruler of the underworld. Following their overthrow of their father Cronus, Poseidon was allotted lordship 
                of the sea. He was commonly associated with the trident, a weapon and primary symbol that might have once been used as a fish spear. According to the Greek poet Hesiod, the 
                trident, akin to Zeus's thunderbolt and Hades's helmet, was crafted by the three Cyclopes.
                <br>
                <br>
                As the god of earthquakes, Poseidon had ties to the land, and his earliest places of worship in Greece were often located inland, though they were sometimes centered around pools, 
                streams, or connected to water in some way. In this aspect, he was known as "enosichthon" and "ennosigaios," both translating to "earth-shaker," and he was venerated as "asphalios," 
                the stabilizer. Poseidon's connection to horses likely arrived in Greece with the earliest Hellenes, who introduced the first horses to the region around the 2nd century BCE. He 
                himself sired numerous horses, the most famous being the winged horse Pegasus through his union with the Gorgon Medusa.
                <br>
                <br>
                Poseidon frequently found himself embroiled in disputes concerning land ownership, most notably in a rivalry for sovereignty over Attica, where he was eventually defeated by the goddess 
                Athena. Despite the loss, Poseidon received worship there, particularly at Colonus, known as "hippios" or "of horses."
                <br>
                <br>
                Poseidon had numerous offspring, including Pelias and Neleus by Tyro, the daughter of Salmoneus, and thus became the divine ancestor of Thessaly and Messenia's royal families. Many of his 
                sons held positions of power in different parts of ancient Greece. He also fathered a host of monstrous offspring, among them giants and savage creatures such as Orion, Antaeus, 
                and Polyphemus. With several consorts, Poseidon was also wed to Amphitrite, an Oceanid, with whom he had multiple children, including the sea creature Triton.
                <br>
                <br>
                The primary festival dedicated to Poseidon was the Isthmia, held every two years near the Isthmus of Corinth. It featured famous athletic competitions, including horse races. 
                Over time, Poseidon became predominantly associated with his role as the sea god, symbolized by the trident, the dolphin, and the tuna. The Romans, overlooking his other aspects, 
                equated him with Neptune, their sea god.
