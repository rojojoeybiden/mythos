            <p>Ares is known in Greek mythology as the god of war, courage, battlelust and civil order. He is not the most popular as he represented the distateful aspects of war and 
            slaughter. His counterpart, MArs, has a much more dignified and important plac ein ancient Roman religion as the ancestral protector of the Roman state and its people.
             This does not stop warriors, kings and people alike from worshipping him or having offerings to the literal war god in times of war between empires.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ares is most well known for his affair with Aphrodite. This affair was exposed within a myth invloving Hephaestus and a net. Hephaestus, upon discovering the affair via Helios,
                set to creating a trap for the two. He fashioned a finely made and nearly invisible net to trap them in. When it was time, the net was triggered and trapped both Ares and Aphrodite
                as they were in the midst of a very intimate embrace. Hephaestus, unsatisfied with this revenge, invited all the other gods and goddesses to view the unfortunate pair. Once the couple
                had been thoroughly embarrassed and then released, Ares returned to hsi homeland, Thrace while Aphrodite went to Paphos.

                He holds many names similar to many gods and goddesses of the same pantheon. 
                Areios, meaning warlike, in the adjective epithet and Enyalios, who was sometimes identified with Ares and differentiated with another war god with a separate cult. 
                In mainland Greece and the few Peleponnese, there are few places that hold a formal temple and cult of Ares. 
                Ares’s attributes are instruments of war like his helmet, shield and sword or spear.

                Ares’ appearances in myth, though not many, typically end with him facing humiliation. He played a 
                pivotal role in the Illiad, his subsequent retreat and humiliation as he returned wounded to Zeus one of 
                the most memorable. The war god often represents the violent or more physical aspects of war.
