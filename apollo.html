            <p>Apollo is the god of many things. He is known as the god of archery, dance, music, truth, prophecy, healing and plagues, the sun, poetry and much much more.
              As the patron deity of Delphi, known as Apollo Pythios, he is an oracular god or the prophetic deity of the Delphic oracle.
              His oracles were often consulted for guidance in various matters. 
              Medicine and the art of heaing are associated with either Apollo himself or his son, Asclepius.
              He helped people from epidemics yet could also bring forth ill health and plague to those who incurred his wrath.
                <br>
                <br>
                Apollo is also a important pastoral deity and was the patron god of herdsmen and shepherds.
                The cult of Apollo in Greece, Delphi and Delos all date back to the 8th century BCE. 
                Delos wsa primarily dedicated to Artemis, his twin sister and goddess of the hunt.
                Delphi worshipped his as the slayer of Python, a monstruous serpent.
                <br>
                <br>
               In the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, the story of his brith goes that when the goddess Leto had gotten pregnant, she could not give birth as Hera had tricked Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, into staying on Olympus.
               It was not until the goddess of birth had set foot on land, that Leto, with help from Iris in retrieving Eileithyia, had given birth to the twins. Leto was in labor for nine days and nights,
               with Apollo "leaping forth" from her womb.
                <br> 
                <br>
                Apollo is most commonly knon for his pursuits in romance and how most of them ended in tragedy. A few of his pursuits were the nymph Daphne, Hyacinthus and Cassandra, who had been cursed with the gift of prophecy for rejecting the god.
                Other myths Apollo is invloved in is the tale of Niobe, where he and Artemis had shot down all of Niobe's children as punishment for her mocking their mother. The most famous of Apollo's chilren is asclepius, known for being extremely skilled at healing
                that he could bring someone back from death. Zeus had had him killed but at Apollo's request, Asclepius had been made a god.
                <br>
                <br>
                Apollo does not appear much in pop media but whenever he does appear, he is usually depicted as blonde, tan and quite handsome.
