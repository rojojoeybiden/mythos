                Achilles, a central figure in Greek mythology, was the son of Peleus, the mortal king of the Myrmidons, and Thetis, a Nereid or sea nymph. Known for his bravery, unparalleled beauty, 
                and remarkable skills as a warrior, Achilles stood as the most exceptional fighter in Agamemnon's army during the Trojan War. As depicted by Homer, Achilles was raised by his mother 
                in Phthia alongside his closest companion, Patroclus. Other tales beyond Homer's accounts suggest various relationships between Patroclus and Achilles, including kinship and even 
                romance. Additionally, a popular legend describes how Thetis dipped Achilles in the River Styx, rendering him nearly invincible, except for his heel, which remained vulnerable—the 
                origin of the term "Achilles' heel."
                <br>
                <br>
                Mythological stories tell of Peleus sending Achilles to Lycomedes on Scyros to avoid the prophecy that Achilles would die in battle at Troy. Disguised as a girl and kept among the king's 
                daughters, Achilles lived there for a while, where he fathered Neoptolemus with Deïdamia. When the Greeks learned from the seer Calchas that Troy couldn't be conquered without Achilles, 
                they sought and found him.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the initial nine years of the war, Achilles besieged Troy's surrounding regions and captured twelve cities. However, a conflict arose in the tenth year when Achilles demanded that 
                Agamemnon return Chryseis, a captive woman and his war prize, to her father, a priest of Apollo. Agamemnon, in retaliation, took Achilles' beloved slave Briseis.
                <br>
                <br>
                Enraged, Achilles withdrew from the battle, causing the Greek forces to struggle. Ultimately, Achilles allowed Patroclus to take his place in combat, equipping him with his chariot and 
                armor. Tragically, Patroclus was slain by Hector, eldest son of King Priam of Troy. Reconciling with Agamemnon, Achilles avenged Patroclus by killing Hector. He then granted Hector's 
                body to Priam at the king's earnest plea. The Iliad concludes with Hector's funeral, omitting Achilles' death. The Odyssey references his funeral, while later epics, like Arctinus' 
                Aethiopis, recount Achilles' demise in battle, killed by Paris, guided by Apollo's arrow, after Achilles had slain Memnon, the Ethiopian king, and Penthesilea, the Amazon warrior 
                queen.
