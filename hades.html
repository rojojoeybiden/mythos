            <p> After his sons overthrew Cronus, they divided his kingdom, and Hades received the underworld through a draw of lots. In this realm, he ruled alongside 
                his queen, Persephone, overseeing the infernal powers and the deceased in what was often referred to as "the house of Hades" or simply Hades. His loyal 
                companion was the three-headed dog Cerberus. Although Hades was responsible for supervising the trial and punishment of the wicked after death, he typically 
                did not serve as one of the judges in the underworld, and he did not personally inflict torment upon the guilty. This task was assigned to the Furies (Erinyes). 
                Hades was depicted as stern and unmerciful, impervious to prayers or offerings, much like death itself. He remained forbidding and distant, his distinct personality 
                remaining veiled in the shadowy darkness of his realm, even in the myth of his abduction of Persephone.
                <br>
                <br>
                These enigmatic and unfathomable qualities were balanced by an opposing, more beneficial aspect. The god of the underworld was commonly worshipped using euphemistic titles 
                like Clymenus ("the Renowned") or Eubouleus ("Good Counsellor"). He was often referred to as Zeus with a specialized epithet, such as chthonios ("chthonian Zeus"). His title 
                Pluto or Pluton ("Wealth") possibly arose from Hades' partial association with a deity of the earth's fertility or because he collected all living beings into his treasury upon 
                their death.
                <br>
                <br>
                As ruler of heaven Zeus led the gods to victory against the Giants (offspring of Gaea and Tartarus) and successfully crushed several revolts against him by 
                his fellow gods. According to the Greek poet Homer, heaven was located on the summit of Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece and the logical home for a 
                weather god. The other members of the pantheon resided there with Zeus and were subject to his will. From his exalted position atop Mount Olympus Zeus was 
                thought to omnisciently observe the affairs of men, seeing everything, governing all, and rewarding good conduct and punishing evil. Besides dispensing justice—
                he had a strong connection with his daughter Dike (Justice)—Zeus was the protector of cities, the home, property, strangers, guests, and supplicants.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, the term Hades was used to represent Sheol, signifying a dark realm of the deceased. Tartarus, initially referring 
                to an abyss located deep below Hades and serving as a place of punishment in the underworld, eventually lost its distinct identity and became nearly synonymous with Hades.
