            <br>
            <p> Heracles, in Greek mythology, was believed to be the son of Zeus and Alcmene, the granddaughter of Perseus. Legend has it that Zeus had sworn that the next male descendant of the 
                Perseid lineage would become the ruler of Greece. However, Hera, Zeus's wife, intervened to deceive the situation, resulting in the birth of Eurystheus, who became king instead. 
                Heracles, the rightful heir, consequently had to serve Eurystheus, enduring Hera's vengeful wrath. His initial feat was to strangle two serpents sent by Hera to kill him in his 
                infancy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Heracles waged a successful war against the kingdom of Orchomenus in Boeotia and married Megara, daughter of King Creon of Thebes. Tragically, driven by madness induced by Hera, 
                he slew Megara and their children. As penance, Heracles became Eurystheus's servant, leading to the famous Labors, a series of twelve seemingly impossible tasks assigned to him.
                <br>
                <br>
                These labors were: (1) slaying the Nemean lion and wearing its impenetrable skin; (2) defeating the nine-headed Hydra of Lerna; (3) capturing the elusive hind (or stag) of Arcadia; 
                (4) capturing the wild boar of Mount Erymanthus; (5) cleaning the cattle stables of King Augeas of Elis in a single day; (6) shooting the monstrous man-eating birds of the Stymphalian 
                marshes; (7) capturing the mad bull terrorizing Crete; (8) seizing the man-eating mares of King Diomedes; (9) obtaining the girdle of Hippolyte, queen of the Amazons; (10) taking the 
                cattle of the three-bodied giant Geryon from the island Erytheia; (11) retrieving the golden apples guarded by the Hesperides at the world's end; and (12) fetching the triple-headed 
                dog Cerberus from the underworld.
                <br>
                <br>
                After completing these Labors, Heracles engaged in further exploits and campaigns, including a battle with the river god Achelous for the hand of Deianeira. His life ended tragically 
                due to the poisoned blood of the Centaur Nessus. Deianeira, in a misguided attempt to secure Heracles's love, unwittingly caused his demise by sending him a garment smeared with Nessus's 
                blood, which proved to be a lethal poison. Heracles was cremated on Mount Oeta, where his mortal remains perished, while his divine essence ascended to the heavens. There, he was reconciled 
                with Hera and married Hebe.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout art and literature, Heracles was depicted as a powerful and robust figure, known for his immense strength, his occasional bursts of anger, and his association with the bow and club. 
                In Italy, he was revered not only as a god of strength but also as a patron deity of traders and merchants, often prayed to for good luck and protection from perils.
